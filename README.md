# Covid19-Prediction

---This project focuses on the machine learning-based prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis using symptom data. Accurate prediction of COVID-19 is essential for early isolation and treatment, which can reduce transmission rates and healthcare burdens. The dataset includes 2,78,848 individuals who underwent tests and contains 11 columns, including 8 features suspected to influence COVID-19 outcomes. We will divide the data into training, validation, and test sets and perform feature engineering tasks, data visualization, and model selection to achieve accurate predictions. ---
